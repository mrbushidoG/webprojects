        <h1>Gulf of Tonkin incident</h1>

        <p>
            The Gulf of Tonkin incident (Vietnamese: Sự kiện Vịnh Bắc Bộ) was an international confrontation that led to
            the
            United States engaging more directly in the Vietnam War. It involved both a proven confrontation on August
            2,
            1964, carried out by North Vietnamese forces in response to covert operations in the coastal region of the
            gulf,
            and a second, claimed confrontation on August 4, 1964, between ships of North Vietnam and the United States
            in
            the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin. Originally American claims blamed North Vietnam for both attacks. Later
            investigation revealed that the second attack never happened; the American claim is that it was based mostly
            on
            erroneously interpreted communications intercepts.[5][6][7]

            On August 2, 1964, the destroyer USS Maddox, while performing a signals intelligence patrol as part of
            DESOTO
            operations, was approached by three Vietnam People's Navy torpedo boats of the 135th Torpedo Squadron.[1][5]
            The
            Maddox fired warning shots and the North Vietnamese boats attacked with torpedoes and machine gun fire.[5]
            In
            the ensuing engagement, one U.S. aircraft (which had been launched from aircraft carrier USS Ticonderoga)
            was
            damaged, three North Vietnamese torpedo boats were damaged, and four North Vietnamese sailors were killed,
            with
            six more wounded. There were no U.S. casualties.[8] Maddox was "unscathed except for a single bullet hole
            from a
            Vietnamese machine gun round".[5]

            On August 4, 1964, destroyer USS Turner Joy joined Maddox on another DESOTO mission. That evening, the ships
            opened fire on radar and sonar returns that had been preceded by communications intercepts which US forces
            claimed meant an attack was imminent. The commander of the Maddox task force, Captain John Herrick, reported
            that the ships were being attacked by North Vietnamese boats when in fact, there were no North Vietnamese
            boats
            present. While Herrick soon reported doubts regarding the task force’s initial perceptions of the attack,
            the
            Johnson administration relied on wrongly interpreted National Security Agency communications intercepts to
            conclude that the attack was real.[5]
