    <p>
        God of War is an action-adventure game franchise created by David Jaffe at Sony's Santa Monica Studio. It began
        in 2005 on the PlayStation 2 (PS2) video game console and has become a flagship series for PlayStation,
        consisting of nine installments across multiple platforms. Based on ancient mythologies, the story follows
        Kratos, a Spartan warrior and later the Greek God of War, who was tricked into killing his family by his former
        master, the original Greek God of War Ares. This sets off a series of events that leads to wars with the
        different mythological pantheons. The Greek-based games see Kratos follow a path of vengeance due to the
        machinations of the Olympian gods, while the Norse-based games, which introduce his son Atreus as a secondary
        protagonist, show Kratos on a path of redemption and inadvertently coming into conflict with the Norse gods.</p>

    <p>
        Santa Monica has developed all main entries, while Ready at Dawn and Javaground/Sony Online Entertainment-Los
        Angeles (SOE-LA) developed the three side games. Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) has published all games
        except the mobile phone installment, which was published by Sony Pictures Digital. The first seven games make up
        the Greek era of the franchise. God of War (2005), God of War II (2007), and God of War III (2010) comprise its
        main trilogy; the first two were released on the PS2 with the third on the PlayStation 3 (PS3). A prequel,
        Ascension (2013), was also released for the PS3. Other games include Chains of Olympus (2008) and Ghost of
        Sparta (2010) for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) and Betrayal (2007) for mobile phones that supported the Java
        Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME). The Norse era began with the 2018 game God of War and released for the
        PlayStation 4 (PS4) and later Windows in January 2022. It was accompanied by a short prequel, A Call from the
        Wilds (2018), a text-based game through Facebook Messenger. A sequel, Ragnar√∂k, was released in November 2022 on
        the PS4 and PlayStation 5 (PS5) and concluded the Norse era.

    <h1 id="mgsr">Metal Gear Rising</h1>
    <img src="Metal_Gear_Rising_Revengeance_box_artwork.jpg" alt="metal gear rising">

    <p>
        Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance[b] is an action-adventure hack and slash video game developed by PlatinumGames
        and published by Konami. It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2013, Microsoft Windows and OS X
        in 2014 and Nvidia Shield TV in 2016. It is a spin-off in the Metal Gear series, set four years after the events
        of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. In the game, the player controls Raiden, a cyborg who confronts the
        private military company Desperado Enforcement, with the gameplay focusing on fighting enemies using a sword and
        other weapons to perform combos and counterattacks. Through the use of Blade Mode, Raiden can cut cyborgs in
        slow motion and steal parts stored in their bodies. The series' usual stealth elements are also optional to
        reduce combat.</p>

    <p>
        The game was originally being developed internally by Kojima Productions, who announced the game in 2009 under
        the title of Metal Gear Solid: Rising. However, the team met with difficulties in developing a game based on
        swordplay, so supervising director Hideo Kojima postponed its development until a solution could be found. The
        project resurfaced in late 2011 under its finalized title, with PlatinumGames as the new developer. The game
        underwent significant changes in its play mechanics and storyline under PlatinumGames' involvement, although
        Kojima Productions retained responsibility for the game's overall plot and Raiden's design.

    <h1 id="ffxv">Final Fantasy XV</h1>
    <img src="FF_XV_cover_art.jpg" alt="final fantasy xv">

    <p>
        Final Fantasy XV[a] is an action role-playing game developed and published by Square Enix. The fifteenth main
        installment of the Final Fantasy series, it was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2016, Windows in
        2018, and as a launch title for Stadia in 2019. The game features an open world environment and action-based
        battle system, incorporating quick-switching weapons, elemental magic, and other features such as vehicle travel
        and camping. The base campaign was later expanded with downloadable content (DLC), adding further gameplay
        options such as additional playable characters and multiplayer.

        Final Fantasy XV takes place on the fictional world of Eos; aside from Insomnia, the capital of Lucis, all the
        world is dominated by the empire of Niflheim, who seek control of the magical Crystal protected by the Lucian
        royal family. On the eve of peace negotiations, Niflheim attacks the capital and steals the Crystal. Noctis
        Lucis Caelum, heir to the Lucian throne, goes on a quest to rescue the Crystal and defeat Niflheim. He later
        learns his full role as the "True King", destined to use the Crystal's powers to save Eos from eternal darkness.
        The game shares a thematic connection with Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a subseries of games linked by
        a common mythos which includes Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy Type-0.

        The game's development began in 2006 as a PlayStation 3 spin-off titled Final Fantasy Versus XIII.[b] Tetsuya
        Nomura served as the original director and character designer. After a development period of six years, it was
        changed to the next mainline title in the series in 2012; Nomura was replaced as director by Hajime Tabata, and
        the game shifted to eighth generation platforms. Due to the changes, the story needed to be rewritten and some
        scenes and characters were repurposed or removed. The setting of Final Fantasy XV was "a fantasy based on
        reality", with locations and creatures based on elements from the real world.

        To supplement the game, Square Enix created a multimedia project called the "Final Fantasy XV Universe", which
        includes a few spin-off games, as well as an anime series and feature film. Gameplay and story-based DLC was
        released between 2017 and 2019. Upon release, Final Fantasy XV was well received by critics. Widespread praise
        was given for its gameplay, visuals and soundtrack, while reception towards its story and presentation was
        mixed. As of May 2022, the game has sold ten million units worldwide, making it one of the best-selling Final
        Fantasy games of all time.
